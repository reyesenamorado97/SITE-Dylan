    <h2>Who am I?</h2>
    <p>Dylan currently attends University of California, Santa Barbara
        <br>
        as a Statistics and Data Science Major. He is in the process
        <br>
        of changing his major to Computer Science, as he has a love <br>
        for the logical problem solving and accomplishing tasks through <br>
        programming provides a deep, unique satisfaction.
    </p>

    <br>
    
    <h2>What I do</h2>
    <p>Aside from education, Dylan is a gigantic fan of the San Francisco 49ers <br>
        and enjoys partaking in sneaker culture. Dylan is the son of Mexican parents <br>
        but he is originally from East Los Angeles. 
    </p> 

    <br>

    <h2>On the Radar...</h2>
    <p>While Dylan is in the process of switching majors, he is currently in <br>
        CodePath and Workday's SITE internship program. Beyond this, he is <br>
        in the process of applying for a software engineering intership at Google. <br>
